### Sensible Uses for this app: ###

* UX designer wanting to know the built-in capabilities of a text field
* Developer trying to figure out what properties should have what values to get desired look/behavior

### Why? ###

I got sick of the seemingly endless loop of tweak-build, tweak-build, etc. Then I figured I would share my creation with the world.
